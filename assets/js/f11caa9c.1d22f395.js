We then grew the disk and grew the filesystem\\n    - This needs to be added as a prereq\\n- There was a constraint in the `sg-lb-template.yaml` requiring subnets sized from /16  o /24. We removed that constraint\\n- Edited `bootstrap-template.yaml` line 91 to remove the wrong key name. (artifact from testing)\\n- Software Evaluation process - define and build internal documentation - TBD\\n- Documentation updates\\n    - Parameter definitions - making them more descriptive\\n- Validation checks\\n    - Creating a validation process before runniing any scripts/installs checking for prerequisites\\n\\n## Decisions and Action Items (DAI)\\n- AWS CLI had a previous installation. Had to manually remove that installation and re-run the aws cli install command.\\n- We decided to run the installation as root user. Root user needed to have the `/usr/local/bin` added to the PATH. Did this manually on the fly with an `export` command.\\n- Customer security to approve selected AMI for coreOS\\n  - The AMI for CoreOS is a public AMI. The customer security team needs to copy it into the dev account as public AMI\'s are blocked in this environment\\n \\n## Next Steps\\n- License and configure Cloud Pak for Data\\n    - Cloud Pak Considerations\\n        -
