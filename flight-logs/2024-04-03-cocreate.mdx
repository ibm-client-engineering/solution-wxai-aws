    end
    C -->D
    D -->E(Install CP4D)
    E -->F(Deploy Services)
```

## Milestones
1. Deploy and configuration of boot node to establish a beach-head into the customer AWS environment
    - Complete
2. Deploy OCP using the documented UPI installation steps
    - Complete
3. Install Cloud Pak for Data
    - In Progress
4. Deploy and configure watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure


### Summary
- Master nodes attempting to upgrade and are in a stuck state preventing rollback of ingress changes
- Attempting to deploy a new cluster
- New cluster successfully deployed via latest script
- Deploying EFS
- Installing OpenShift Data Foundation & Standalone Multicloud Object Gateway

## Decisions and Action Items (DAI)
- Software evaluation awaiting customer's approval process. This blocks our ability to download software from cp.icr.io
    - Customer to escalate internally

## Next Steps
- License and configure Cloud Pak for Data
    - Cloud Pak Considerations
        - Security scans needed on container images 
        - Customer requires on-prem, offline install
        - Customer uses their own container registry that might introduce extra effort or compatability issues 
        - Version compatibility with OpenShift (e.g. 4.10 required and customer has 4.11) 
        - Supported storage not available 
        - Multiple cloudpaks on the same cluster 
        - custom connections to data sources not supported OOTB 
        - AWS-specific: IAM users required for install/deploy and are not allowed 
        - OpenShift specific: CoreOS requirement for control nodes 
        - Automatic updating of Cloud Pak, this can interrupt engagements (solution is to always remove update polling from operators)
- Deploy watsonx.ai
- Application configurations
- Application validations
