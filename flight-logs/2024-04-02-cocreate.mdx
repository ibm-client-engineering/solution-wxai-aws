## Objective
Deploy watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure for customer software evaluation

    end
    C -->D
    D -->E(Install CP4D)
    E -->F(Deploy Services)
```

## Milestones
1. Deploy and configuration of boot node to establish a beach-head into the customer AWS environment
    - Complete
2. Deploy OCP using the documented UPI installation steps
    - Complete
3. Install Cloud Pak for Data
    - In Progress
4. Deploy and configure watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure

## Today's Accomplishments
- Verifying cluster health in preparation for Cloud Pak for Data install
- Verifying network connectivity to application pods

### Summary
- Attempting to resolve domain name of the OpenShift portal
    - Added required cluster-wide settings to proxy
        - Added wxai domain information to noProxy configuration `oc edit proxy/cluster`
        - Investigating OpenShift error `certificate is valid for oauth-openshift.openshift-authentication.svc`
        - Cluster pieces updating, validating health of cluster on later call (may be related to current certificate errors)
    - More nodes in "ready" state
    - 1 master node continuing to update causing cluster connectivity issues
    - Attempting to drain and restart pending nodes

## Decisions and Action Items (DAI)
- Software evaluation awaiting customer's approval process. This blocks our ability to download software from cp.icr.io
    - Customer to escalate internally

## Next Steps
- License and configure Cloud Pak for Data
    - Cloud Pak Considerations
        - Security scans needed on container images 
        - Customer requires on-prem, offline install
        - Customer uses their own container registry that might introduce extra effort or compatability issues 
        - Version compatibility with OpenShift (e.g. 4.10 required and customer has 4.11) 
        - Supported storage not available 
        - Multiple cloudpaks on the same cluster 
        - custom connections to data sources not supported OOTB 
        - AWS-specific: IAM users required for install/deploy and are not allowed 
        - OpenShift specific: CoreOS requirement for control nodes 
        - Automatic updating of Cloud Pak, this can interrupt engagements (solution is to always remove update polling from operators)
- Deploy watsonx.ai
- Application configurations
- Application validations
