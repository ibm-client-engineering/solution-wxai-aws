## Objective
Deploy watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure for customer software evaluation

    D(Prepare CP4D & watsonx ai cartdridge)
    end
    C -->D
    D -->E(Install CP4D)
    E -->F(Deploy Services)
```


## Milestones
1. Deploy and configuration of boot node to establish a beach-head into the customer AWS environment
    - Complete
2. Deploy OCP using the documented UPI installation steps
    - Complete
3. Install Cloud Pak for Data
    - In Progress
4. Deploy and configure watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure on ref environment and document
    - In Progress

### Summary
- Awaiting entitlement key approval on customer side

## Decisions and Action Items (DAI)
- Software evaluation awaiting customer's approval process. This blocks our ability to download software from cp.icr.io
    - Customer to provide by EOD Monday
- Worker nodes shutdown until approval comes through
- Drafted and sent instructions for the customer to resize the worker node disks for when the cluster is brought back online
- Drafted and sent instructions for the customer to order a GPU Node
    - GPU node to be added to the cluster and then cordoned, drained, and shutdown

## Lessons Learned
- Preparation for Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShift sizing needed to be adjusted to reflect an under-provisioning of CPU resources
- watsonx.ai service requires larger local disks on worker nodes (500Gb)
- The GPU node required for watsonx.ai seems to be a limited resource

## Next Steps
- License and configure Cloud Pak for Data
    - Cloud Pak Considerations
        - Security scans needed on container images 
        - Customer requires on-prem, offline install
        - Customer uses their own container registry that might introduce extra effort or compatability issues 
        - Version compatibility with OpenShift (e.g. 4.10 required and customer has 4.11) 
        - Supported storage not available 
        - Multiple cloudpaks on the same cluster 
        - custom connections to data sources not supported OOTB 
        - AWS-specific: IAM users required for install/deploy and are not allowed 
        - OpenShift specific: CoreOS requirement for control nodes 
        - Automatic updating of Cloud Pak, this can interrupt engagements (solution is to always remove update polling from operators)
    - Resize local disks for worker nodes
    - Customer to order a GPU node and attach it to the cluster
- Deploy watsonx.ai
