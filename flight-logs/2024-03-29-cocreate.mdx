## Objective
- Evaluate Watsonx Discovery vs Chromadb for vector store 
- Start ideating & testing sample complete workflows

## Milestones
1. Successfully configured working Wx Discovery Vector Store with chunking, embeddings and ELSER semantic search 
2. Connected this KB in WXD to Watsonx Assistant
3. Developed method to parse & detect RAG responses that give step by step instructions, which can be used to create guided workflows

## Lessons learned
- Wx Discovery seems to have more accurate chunk retrieval than Chromadb
- Wx Discovery out-of-the box chatbot answers are also better
- Config is simple and can be done in an hour with prewritten code by just passing in credentials

## Next Steps
- Continue building guided conversations & enable them to conduct operations autonomously
