    end
```

## Milestones
1. Deploy and configuration of boot node to establish a beach-head into the customer AWS environment
    - Complete
2. Deploy OCP using the documented UPI installation steps
    - Complete
3. Install Cloud Pak for Data
    - Complete
4. Deploy and configure watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure on ref environment and document
    - In Progress

### Summary
- Testing NeuralSeek functionality
- NeuralSeek verified opperational
- Configuring watsonx Assistant ServiceNow extension
    - Unable to access ServiceNow, getting blocked outbound
    - Investigating AWS and Cluster network connectivity
        - Curl requests working from bastion, not from application or cluster
    - Issue found: Customer proxy needs to be used in all API requests (even though cluster is configured to use proxy)
        - ~~Proposed workaround: Add proxy to OpenAPI spec for watsonx Assistant and Orchestrate~~
    - Fix: Configure cluster environments to use customer proxy
            ```
            oc set env deployment --all http_proxy=http://my_proxy:my_port
            oc set env deployment --all https_proxy=http://my_proxy:my_port
            ```

## Decisions and Action Items (DAI)
- ServiceNow connectivity being investigated
    - Issue with proxy configuration not allowing watsonx Assistant/Orchestrate communication with ServiceNow.com

## Lessons Learned
- If a proxy is required, the proxy configuration needs to be applied to the deployment environments for cluster applications to use the proxy. Initially the proxy was only applied to the cluster itself, not the deployment environments.

## Next Steps
- Application configuration
    - NeuralSeek
    - watsonx.ai Prompt Lab
    - watsonx Assistant
    - watsonx Orchestrate
        - ServiceNow skills
        - Microsoft Outlook skills
