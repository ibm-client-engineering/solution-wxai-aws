## Objectives

- Deploy watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure.

## Accomplishments
**AWS**
- Fixes to cluster-sts.yaml and other deployment resources.
    - Fixed error in cluster-sts.yml by commenting out lines 590-599.
    - Changed ``IamInstanceProfile: !Ref BootnodeInstanceProfile`` to ``IamInstanceProfile: <InstanceProfileName>``
    - Changed ``SubnetId: !Ref PublicSubnet1ID``  to ``SubnetId: <PrivateSubnetID>`` to account for private deployments
    - Updated LambdaExecutionRole.json line 14: from ``ec2.aws.com`` to ``lambda.aws.com`` and added ``cloudformation.aws.com`` of allowed services.
    - Fixed LambdaExecutionRole ARN to proper role name.
    - Commented out /bin/bash ./cp-deploy.sh env apply -e env_id=${ClusterName} [--accept-all-licenses]
    - Added VPC and Subnet IDs to the “CleanupLambda”  lambda function in cluster-sts, which then required adding “ec2:CreateNetworkInterface” permission to LambdaExecutionRole
    - Adding tags to CleanupLambda with Application IDs.
- Successful deployment of BootNode instance.



**RAG**
- Creation of cronjob to capture logs from Python app.
- Enabled metadata insertion into chunks in vector store -> (hopefully) increases retrieval accuracy
- Return context to user (shows sources used to generate responses)
- Added mixtral model support
- Enable functionality for user to give custom rag parameters
- Migrated vector DB from FAISS to chromaDB to enable the metadata functionality
- Script written to easily test rag implementation and save results in csv
- Implemented cache logic to make sure it considers combination of parameters as well before chosing to send a cached response



## In Progress
- End-to-end deployment of OCP, CP4D, and watsonx.ai (with GPU node)
- Tagging cp-deployer.sh generated resources.
- Updating solution docs with better asset linking.



## Next Steps
- Continue over the shoulder working sessions
    - Kick off CloudFormation template install with updated STS templates.
- Compilation of required endpoints
- Deploy latest RAG version on AWS
- Build out actions & flow in Watsonx Assistant after properly defining personas & objectives.
- Kick off Cloud Pak for Deployment entitlement key.


## Tracking (Issues)
- Require sign-off on final CloudFormation template.
- Red Hat CoreOS AMI pending approval.
- LambdaCleanup error from not being able to assume role.
- Double checking role names in Cloudformation template.
