- Added mixtral model support
- Enable functionality for user to give custom rag parameters
- Migrated vector DB from FAISS to chromaDB to enable the metadata functionality
- Script written to easily test rag implementation and save results in csv
- Implemented cache logic to make sure it considers combination of parameters as well before chosing to send a cached response



## In Progress
