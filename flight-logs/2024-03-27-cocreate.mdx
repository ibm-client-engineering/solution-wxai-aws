## Objective
Deploy watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure forr customer software evaluation

    end
    A-->B
    B --> C(Install CP4D)
    C -->D[Deploy watsonx.ai]
```

## Milestones
1. Deploy and configuration of boot node to establish a beach-head into the Fidelity AWS environment
    - Complete
2. Deploy OCP using the documented UPI installation steps
    - In progress
3. Install CloudPak for Data
4. Deploy and configure watsonx.ai on self-managed AWS infrastructure

## Today's Accomplishments

### Script Attempts
#### Cleanup Steps
- Remove metadata file from "wxai" directory
- Delete stacks created
- Ignore initial "FATAL" error logged
#### Attempt 1
- Communication Issues
    1. httpd not running on bootnode/bastion due to previous reboot
    - Fix: Enable httpd service on OS. Script change also made to force
    2. Egress rules added to bootnode and master
        - AWS default egress connections needed to be manually configured to 10.0.0.0/8 vs AWS default value 0.0.0.0/0 for "all" traffic
#### Attempt 2
- Running OCP process manually (outside of script)
- Unable to pull images
    - Incorrectly pulling images from the bastion host, should be local registry
    - Temporary fix: Run `./start_registy.sh /ibm 5000`
    - Fix failed
    - Investigating ignition configuration
    - Fix: Add deleting state data to the cleanup process
#### Attempt 3
- Start-from-scratch approach
- Issue found in authentication configuration. The script is improperly configured to more than 1 authentication set
    - This customer deployment requires multiple authentication sets: quai.io, RedHat registry, Artifactory. Only one was tested
- Using workaround by manually adding the pullsecret to the create_install_config.sh
- Running `create_cluster_step_1.sh` 
    - Successful
    - Updated LB DNS configurations
- Running `create_cluster_step_2.sh` 
- Stalled - ignitions not firing
    - bootnode and master security group needed IP range (addition to Attempt 1 egress issues, added code changes)
- Error
    - Issue with Openshift installer extraction. For this customer case, we are not using local registry
    - Fix: Use general use OpenShift installer from Redhat, which does not assume local registry
#### Attempt 4
- Cleanup Process
    - Delete stacks
    - Remove install state and metadata
- Running `create_cluster_step_2.sh`
- Updated LB DNS configurations
    -  Worker security group needed IP range (addition to Attempt 1 and Attempt 2 egress issues, added code changes)
- Unable to use OpenShift API (oc command) to view pods due to use of untrusted certificates
    - Workaround use "insecure" connection
    - Communicate using --insecure-skip-tls-verify when using oc - Example: `oc --insecure-skip-tls-verify get pods -A`
    - Removed worker node volumes (1tb)
#### Attempt 5
- Retrying using default OpenShift Certificates
    - Updated config and removed certificate configuration
- Cleanup Process
    - Delete stacks
    - Remove install state and metadata
- Running `create_cluster_step_2.sh`
- Running for a few hours, still recieving certificate failure but continueing install
- 3/all Worker nodes communicatting
#### Attempt 6
- Removed IPI (for UPI) step
- Removed {registry_url} image content sources from imageContentSources (Airgap) from install config.sh
- Removed fips mode from install config.sh
- Added to cleanup process
    - Removed .kube
    - unset $KUBCONFIG
- Delete ignition file

## Decisions and Action Items (DAI)
- Software evaluation licenses for CP4D and watsonx.ai
    - Approval

## Next Steps
- License and configure Cloud Pak for Data
    - Cloud Pak Considerations
        - Security scans needed on container images 
        - Customer requires on-prem, offline install
        - Customer uses their own container registry that might introduce extra effort or compatability issues 
        - Version compatibility with OpenShift (e.g. 4.10 required and customer has 4.11) 
        - Supported storage not available 
        - Multiple cloudpaks on the same cluster 
        - custom connections to data sources not supported OOTB 
        - AWS-specific: IAM users required for install/deploy and are not allowed 
        - OpenShift specific: CoreOS requirement for control nodes 
        - Automatic updating of Cloud Pak, this can interrupt engagements (solution is to always remove update polling from operators)
- Deploy watsonx.ai
