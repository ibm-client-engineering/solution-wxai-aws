## Installation Steps

### Preparing

#### Obtain the AWS IAM credentials

If you can use your permanent security credentials for the AWS account, you will need an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for the deployer to setup an OpenShift cluster on AWS. 

- Go to https://aws.amazon.com/
- Login to the AWS console
- Click on your user name at the top right of the screen
- Select **Security credentials**. You can also reach this screen via https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-2#/security_credentials.
- If you do not yet have an access key (or you no longer have the associated secret), create an access key
- Store your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in safe place

#### Configure AWS config

Run the following command and then enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region, and Output.

```
aws configure
````

#### Redhat pull secret

The Red Hat pull secret can be downloaded from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-pull-secret. \

After downloading the file, it will need to be uploaded to s3.


#### Create s3 bucket

```
BUCKET="Bucket_NAME"
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $BUCKET --region us-east-1
```

#### Create pull-secrets folder in s3 bucket

```
aws s3api put-object --bucket $BUCKET --key "pull-secets" --region us-east-1
```

#### Upload pull-secrets.json to s3bucket/pull-secrets

```
aws s3 cp pull-secrets.json s3://$BUCKET/pull-secrets/pull-secrets.json
```

#### Create AWS KeyPair

The following commands create the KeyPair, outputs the file to the default ssh folder. The second command modifies the permissions of the file.

```
aws ec2 create-key-pair  --key-name $KEYPAIR_NAME --key-type rsa --key-format pem --query "KeyMaterial" --output text > ~/.ssh/$KEYPAIR_NAME.pem
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/$KEYPAIR_NAME.pem
```

### Prepare

#### Preparing the installion files

The default "AvailabilityZones" in ***clusters.yaml*** are **"us-east-2a,us-east-2b,us-east-2c"** but can be changed.\
To change which Availability Zones are used, search ***clusters.yaml*** for ```us-east-2a,us-east-2b,us-east-2c``` and replace with the preferred Availability Zones.\
Search ***clusters.yaml*** for ```REPLACE_ME_WITH_SUBNET_ID``` and replace with a specific subnetID.

#### Preparing Parameters Override file

Review ***"parameters-override.yaml"***, the following changes will need to be made
- Add API Key
- Add KeyPairName
- Add Private Subnets
- Add Public Subnets
- Add Red Hat Pull Secret s3 location
- Add VPC ID
- Add Bucket Name for s3 bucket that is being used by Red Hat Pull secret
- Add Domain Name
- Add Cluster Name
- Add CPD External Registry

### Deployment

#### Create OCPInstall Role
[Download the OCPInstallRole.yaml](../../assets/Cloudformation/OCPInstallRole.yaml) \
Create the role by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name OCPInstall-role-1 -template-file OCPInstallRole.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --tags *add Key=Value tag here*
```

#### Create LambdaExecution Role
[Download the LambdaExecutionRole.yaml](../../assets/Cloudformation/LambdaExecutionRole.yaml) \
Create the role by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name LambdaExecutionRole -template-file LambdaExecutionRole.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --tags *add Key=Value tag here*
```
#### Create OCPCloudform Role
[Download the OCPCloudFormRole.yaml](../../assets/Cloudformation/OCPCloudFormRole.yaml) \
Create the role by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name OCPCloudFormRole -template-file OCPCloudFormRole.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --tags *add Key=Value tag here*
```

#### Deply cloudformation template using AWS CLI
Using the OCPInstall role arn, run the following command to start the main cloudformation deployment:

```
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name stack-deployment-1 --template-file cluster-sts.yaml --parameter-overrides file://STS-parameters-override.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --tags *add Key=Value tag here* --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT>:role/OCPInstall
```

Check the AWS Console to see when the cloudformation template has progressed far enough that the bootnode is online.

Using the ssh key from the Key Pair name used in parameters-override.yaml, ssh to the bootnode.


### Monitor

#### SSM into bootnode

Add ```AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore``` policy to role used to execute the cloudform template and the user/role that will be connecting to the instance.

The cloudform template creates a boot node that will begin executing commands. One set of commands installs, enables, and starts ```amazon-ssm-agent```. It may take up to 20 minutes before this agent comes online in the boot node.

Once the instance has started the ssm agent a connection can be initiated with following command:

```
aws ssm start-session --target $InstanceID
```
Once a connection has been opened, you may need to change users to the 'ec2-user'. This can be accomplished with the following commands:

Become ```root```

```
sudo su
```
Become ```ec2-user```

```
su ec2-user
```

You will now be able to review deployment logs.

#### Fixing aws command in SSM

<details>
<summary><b>Fixing aws command in SSM</b></summary>
SSM does not work exactly the same as SSH. If you intend to use any additional commands, such as ```aws```, then you need to do the following:

Check the output of running the  ```aws``` command,
If there is an error message like this:

```
[47863] Error loading Python lib '/usr/bin/libpython3.11.so.1.0': dlopen: /usr/bin/libpython3.11.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
Another possible error message:

```
$ aws

  PYTHONHOME = '/usr/bin'
  PYTHONPATH = (not set)
  program name = '/usr/bin/aws'
  isolated = 0
  environment = 0
  user site = 0
  safe_path = 0
  import site = 0
  is in build tree = 0
  stdlib dir = ''
  sys._base_executable = '/usr/bin/aws'
  sys.base_prefix = ''
  sys.base_exec_prefix = ''
  sys.platlibdir = 'lib'
  sys.executable = '/usr/bin/aws'
  sys.prefix = ''
  sys.exec_prefix = ''
  sys.path = [
    '/usr/bin/base_library.zip',
    '/usr/bin/lib-dynload',
    '/usr/bin',
  ]
Fatal Python error: init_fs_encoding: failed to get the Python codec of the filesystem encoding
Python runtime state: core initialized
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'

Current thread 0x00007fed39a06c00 (most recent call first):
  <no Python frame>
```
You may not have the correct $PATH. 

Incorrect $PATH:
```
$ echo $PATH
/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
```

How to Correct $PATH:

```
export PATH="/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin"
```

How to persist the change to $PATH:

```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin"' >> .bashrc
```

Confirm this change works:

```
$ echo $PATH
/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
$ aws

usage: aws [options] <command> <subcommand> [<subcommand> ...] [parameters]
To see help text, you can run:

  aws help
  aws <command> help
  aws <command> <subcommand> help

aws: error: the following arguments are required: command
```

</details>

#### Monitor the deployment

Check what folders exist in the ec2-home directory. if "cpd-status" has not been created yet, then wait a few minutes. Once "cpd-status" directory appears, run the following command:

```
tail -f ~/cpd-status/log/cloud-pak-deployer
```

This command will show the log file from the cp-deployer process.
