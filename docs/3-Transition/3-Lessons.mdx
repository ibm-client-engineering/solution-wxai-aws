## Cloudformation Template

#### Functions in Cloudformation Templates

The following code was originally included in the Cloudformation template, however we discovered that it was formatted in a way to caused errors and prevented the creation of the stack:

```
  SubnetsInVPC:
    Assertions:
      - Assert: !EachMemberIn
          - !ValueOfAll
            - AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id
            - VpcId
          - !RefAll 'AWS::EC2::VPC::Id'
        AssertDescription: All subnets must in the VPC      
```

To fix this, we replaced the shortcut for a function which is an explamation point ```!```,  with an explicit function denoted as ```FN::```. This is the updated code:

```
  SubnetsInVPC:
    Assertions:
    - Assert:
        Fn::EachMemberIn:
        - Fn::ValueOfAll:
          - AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id
          - VpcId
        - Fn::RefAll: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
      AssertDescription: All subnets must in the VPC
```

##### Bootnode Subnet 


When we ran the Cloudformation template, we were given an error message:

```
No default VPC for this user. GroupName is only supported for EC2-Classic and default VPC.
```

This error was a by-product of running the template without any Public subnets attached. The code block below shows that the boot node requires a public subnet for the ```SubnetID```. 

```
      IamInstanceProfile: !Ref BootnodeInstanceProfile
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: 
            !Sub
            - "${ClusterName}-bootnode"
            - ClusterName: !Ref ClusterName 
      InstanceType: t3.large 
      NetworkInterfaces:
      - GroupSet:
        - !Ref BootnodeSecurityGroup
        AssociatePublicIpAddress: true
        DeviceIndex: '0'
        DeleteOnTermination: true
        SubnetId: !Ref PublicSubnet1ID  
      UserData:
```
There are two ways to resolve this problem:

1) Use public subnets when creating the stack
or
2) Replace ```SubnetId: !Ref PublicSubnet1ID```  with a private subnetID ```SubnetId: subnet-example5b646```
